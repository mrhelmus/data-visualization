# data-visualization

This repository was used during my internship at NEON during the summer of 2019. Within this repo are all of the R files I used to practice working with NEON data, the shiny apps that I practiced with, and my final products: 
**pheno-and-agdd** and **NEONDataStory_PhenologyAGDD_final.docx**, both within the final-products directory.

# pheno-and-agdd

This shiny app can be accessed using the following link: [pheno-and-agdd](https://kbradle1.shinyapps.io/pheno-and-agdd/).
This app allows a user to choose one of ten NEON sites to observe plant phenology data, AGDDs, or plant phenology data with AGDDs overlayed for a selected number of years.
The user can also view the application info, which contains definitions, calculation information, and a field site map.
Data for this project was accessed from the [NEON Data Portal](https://data.neonscience.org/home).
